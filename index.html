            <p>Cheree is an aspiring developer, a hardcore animal advocate, and a loveable smart ass. Never underestimate her stature, her dark sense of humor can throw down with the best of them.</p>
            <p>A Utah native with a wan·der·lust heart and a life motto of "not all who wander are lost," Cheree has been known to roam about in Rome, get lost, visit every water fountain, and end up at dinner with the Italian mafia. She loves spontaneous road trips and adventures with her favorite partner in crime, her 18 year old daughter.</p>
            <p>Cheree loves to learn and practices in the philosophy that you can never know too much, hence why she's enrolled in this class.</p>
            <p>A thought-provoking movie, an intellectual conversation, or an intense book paired with a glass of wine or whiskey on the rocks is her idea of a quintessential day.</p>
